# CIRPIN: Learning Circular Permutation-Invariant Representations to Uncover Putative Protein Homologs

This repository contains the code for CIRPIN, submitted to MLCB 2025 workshop. 

## Installation

1. Installation requires Progres ( [paper link](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformaticsadvances/article/5/1/vbaf042/8107707)). The installation for [Progres](https://github.com/greener-group/progres?tab=readme-ov-file). [TM-align](https://aideepmed.com/TM-align/)is also required.


## Novel Circular Permutations

Novel pairs of proteins related by circular permutation are listed in `CIRPIN_novel_CP_pairs.csv`
