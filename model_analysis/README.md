# Embedding Analysis Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing model embeddings and assessing the dependence of representations on positional information.

## Notebooks

- **`cp_comparison.ipynb`** — Compares Progres, CIRPIN, TM-align, and TM-align (-cp) scores across synthetic circular permutation (synCP) pairs.
- **`compare_node_embs.ipynb`** — Evaluates node-level embedding similarities between protein pairs.
